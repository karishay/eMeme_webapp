eMeme | a Meme Recommendation Engine
====================================

eMeme is a web app and chrome extension internet meme recommendation engine that 
uses machine learning and natural language processing to find the best meme for 
any situation. The machine learning algorithm is powered by a Neo4j graph database
using Py2neo to communicate with the Python microframework, Flask. The front end of 
the web app is built with Gumby, styled with Sass, and powered by javaScript and Jquery.
To populate the database, I created a webscraper using PyQuery.
